# odin-recipes

I'm currently working on an odin project to build a basic recipe website 
using my new found knowledge on HTML to showcase a diverse collection of recipes,
the website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Upon completion, this project should demonstrate my proficiency in HTML
and ability to structure web content effectively.

This project should also be able to showcase my skills in creating user-friendly
interfaces and organizing information in a coherent and visually appealing manner.

...It's all about making recipes easy to find and fun to explore...
